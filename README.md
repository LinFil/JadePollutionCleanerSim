# JadePollutionCleanerSim
A beginner-friendly JADE project simulating a multi-agent system where a polluter agent randomly pollutes cells in a grid environment, and cleaner agents compete to clean them based on cost. This project showcases agent communication and negotiation using JADE's messaging system, providing a simple, educational introduction to multi-agent systems.
